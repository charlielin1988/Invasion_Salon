# <p align =center> Invasion Salon

### _Description_

This project will serve as a blueprint for a real-life salon. I have created a full-stack, full CRUD application in which a user can:

- Create Appointments
- Read Salon services, About page, and Created Appointments
- Update Appointments
- Delete Appointments

Future Updates will include:

- User Authentication
- User-Specific Account and Appointment Information
